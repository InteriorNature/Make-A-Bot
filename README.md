# Make-A-Bot Vue App
This is responsive design, server-side rendered Vue shopping app. I first made it to study Vue (Pluralsight class). Since the class was focussed on Vue, it was a non-responsive design with a complex layout. It was a good case for testing both GridCSS and Flex retroactively. I went with Flex: the use of relative positioning of components was ideal for the collection of images and selection guides positioned in a cross pattern (a non-linear arrangement.) I also added root variables for @media sizing changes and added a window matchMedia for a toggling Vue slot.
